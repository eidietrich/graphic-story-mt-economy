    --> Are circles and waffles too visually distinct?
- by-region-change
    --> Adjust facet-plot code to create colored boundaries, reflow into AI
    --> desktop on-hover: Add bar labels and figures
- by-sector-change
    --> Indicate what circle size means somehow
- non-wage-income
    --> BUILD THIS
